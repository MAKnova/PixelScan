## Research Paper

[IEEE Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10718622)
- Abstract:  
   > The extensive spread of DeepFake images on the internet has emerged as a significant challenge, with applications ranging from harmless entertainment to harmful acts like blackmail, misinformation, and spreading false propaganda. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces a sophisticated DeepFake detection model designed to identify and mitigate the increase of these deceptive images. The model architecture integrates an ensemble approach, combining the strengths of two pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models—MobileNet and Xception—with a novel CNN architecture, the Advanced CNN (ACNN). This rigorous validation process enabled the model to achieve a high accuracy rate of 97.89% in detecting DeepFakes.

## Methodology

### Proposed Architecture
The ensemble model combines:
1. **Advanced CNN (ACNN)**:
   - Custom-designed convolutional layers for efficient feature extraction.
   - Efficient processing with pooling, dropout, and batch normalization.
   - Binary cross-entropy loss with Adam optimizer for robust training.
2. **MobileNet**:
   - Pretrained lightweight CNN optimized for mobile applications.
3. **Xception**:
   - Depthwise separable convolutions for advanced feature recognition.

### Ensemble Mechanism
- Each model independently classifies the input image as real or fake.
- Predictions are aggregated using a **majority voting mechanism** to ensure reliability.

### Datasets Used
1. **140k Real and Fake Faces Dataset**:
   - Real images: Nvidia’s Flickr collection.
   - Fake images: StyleGAN-generated images.
   - Augmented with rotations, brightness changes, and cropping for diversity.
2. **Fake-vs-Real Faces (Hard)**:
   - Real images: Unsplash API (processed with OpenCV).
   - Fake images: StyleGAN2 from "thispersondoesnotexist.com".
